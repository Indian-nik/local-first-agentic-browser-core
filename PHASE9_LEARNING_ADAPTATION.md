## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Online Learning
```python
from learning.online_learner import OnlineLearner

learner = OnlineLearner()

# Learn from user feedback
action_result = agent.execute_action("search_query")
feedback = user.provide_feedback(action_result)
learner.update_from_feedback(action_result, feedback)

# Auto-improve future actions
improved_action = learner.optimize_action("search_query")
```

### Preference Personalization
```python
from learning.preference_engine import PreferenceEngine

prefs = PreferenceEngine()

# Learn user preferences
prefs.observe_interaction(user_id, action, outcome)

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = prefs.predict_preferences(user_id, context)
```

### Skill Acquisition
```python
from learning.skill_acquisition import SkillAcquisitionEngine

skills = SkillAcquisitionEngine()

# Identify skill gaps
gaps = skills.analyze_gaps(user_profile, target_skills)

# Generate learning path
path = skills.create_learning_path(gaps, user_learning_style)

# Adapt difficulty
next_lesson = skills.get_adaptive_content(current_progress)
```

### Context Adaptation
```python
from learning.context_adapter import ContextAdapter

adapter = ContextAdapter()

# Monitor context
context = adapter.detect_context(environment, user_state)

# Adapt behavior
strategy = adapter.select_strategy(task, context)
adapted_action = adapter.apply_adaptation(action, strategy)
```

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing System

### Memory Integration
