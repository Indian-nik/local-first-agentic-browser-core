# Architecture Specification

## Overview
This document defines the architecture and specifications for the local-first agentic browser core system.

## Components

### agent-core-golang
The main agent orchestration layer written in Go. Handles:
- Agent lifecycle management
- Task coordination
- Communication between components

### inference-kernel-c
Low-level inference engine written in C for performance. Provides:
- Fast inference execution
- Model loading and management
- Memory-efficient operations

### reasoning-engine-python
High-level reasoning capabilities written in Python. Implements:
- Complex reasoning algorithms
- Decision-making logic
- Integration with ML frameworks

## Communication Protocol
Components communicate via gRPC/REST APIs.

## Data Flow
1. Agent Core receives requests
2. Routes to appropriate component (Inference Kernel or Reasoning Engine)
3. Processes response and returns result
