# local-first-agentic-browser-core

## Overview

This project delivers a production-grade, local-first agentic browser framework designed for expert-level AI-driven web automation. Built on cutting-edge principles of distributed systems, zero-trust security, and polyglot microservices, it enables autonomous agents to navigate, interact with, and extract data from web applications with enterprise-grade reliability and observability.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Agent Runtime**: DSPy-powered reasoning engine with RAG capabilities for context-aware decision-making
- **Browser Engine**: Headless browser orchestration with WebDriver protocol support
- **Memory Layer**: Local-first persistence with CRDT-based conflict resolution for offline-first operations
- **Security Module**: Zero-trust architecture with certificate-based authentication and encrypted data at rest
- **Observability Stack**: Comprehensive logging (EFK), metrics (Prometheus), and visualization (Grafana)

### Technology Stack
- **Go**: High-performance core services, concurrency primitives
- **C**: Low-level browser integration, memory-efficient operations
- **Python**: AI/ML pipeline, DSPy orchestration, data processing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, WASM modules, Kubernetes orchestration

## Core Principles

1. **Local-First**: Data ownership, offline capability, sync-when-connected
2. **Zero Trust**: Assume breach, verify explicitly, least privilege access
3. **Polyglot Excellence**: Right tool for right job, language-agnostic interfaces
4. **AI-Native**: Reasoning over rules, context over commands
5. **Cloud-Native**: Container-first, horizontally scalable, infrastructure-as-code
6. **Observable**: Metrics, logs, traces - telemetry-driven operations

## Features

### Local-First Principle
- Offline-first data persistence with automatic synchronization
- CRDT-based conflict resolution for distributed state management
- Client-side encryption ensuring data privacy

### Polyglot Microservices (Go/C/Python)
- **Go**: API gateway, service mesh, concurrent request handling
- **C**: Browser bindings, memory-critical operations, native extensions
- **Python**: ML model serving, DSPy chains, data analytics pipelines

### AI Reasoning Layer (DSPy, RAG)
- DSPy-powered agentic workflows with self-optimization
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-enhanced responses
- Vector database integration for semantic search capabilities

### Zero Trust Security
- mTLS for all inter-service communication
- Certificate-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Encrypted data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- Network segmentation with micro-perimeter enforcement

### Cloud-Native Deployability (Docker, WASM, K8s)
- Docker containers for consistent runtime environments
- WASM modules for edge deployment and sandboxed execution
- Kubernetes manifests with Helm charts for orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment

### Observability (EFK, Prometheus, Grafana)
- **EFK Stack**: Elasticsearch for indexing, Fluentd for log aggregation, Kibana for exploration
- **Prometheus**: Time-series metrics collection with PromQL queries
- **Grafana**: Real-time dashboards, alerting, multi-datasource visualization
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for request flow analysis

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular architecture with three core components:

### agent-core-golang/
Golang-based agent orchestration layer.
- `main.go` - Entry point for the agent core
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for deployment

### inference-kernel-c/
C-based inference engine for high-performance model execution.
- `main.c` - Entry point for the inference kernel
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for deployment

### reasoning-engine-python/
Python-based reasoning and decision-making engine.
- `main.py` - Entry point for the reasoning engine
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for deployment

### Root Documentation
- `spec.md` - Architecture specifications and component definitions
- `memory.md` - Memory architecture and management strategies

## Running Components

Each component can be run standalone or via Docker:

**Agent Core (Golang):**
```bash
cd agent-core-golang
go run main.go
# or with Docker:
docker build -t agent-core .
docker run agent-core
```

**Inference Kernel (C):**
```bash
cd inference-kernel-c
gcc -o inference-kernel main.c && ./inference-kernel
# or with Docker:
docker build -t inference-kernel .
docker run inference-kernel
```

**Reasoning Engine (Python):**
```bash
cd reasoning-engine-python
python main.py
