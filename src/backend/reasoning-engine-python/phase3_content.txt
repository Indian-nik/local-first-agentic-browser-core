# Integration 5: Zero Trust & Security Hardening

## Overview
This integration implements comprehensive security hardening for the local-first agentic browser, enforcing strict trust boundaries between user instructions and web content while hardening the container and Kubernetes runtime environment.

## Core Components

### 1. Strict Trust Segregation
**Objective**: Establish clear boundaries between trusted user instructions and untrusted webpage content

#### Implementation Approach:
- **Context Tagging System**
  - Tag all user inputs as TRUSTED context
  - Tag all webpage/external content as UNTRUSTED context
  - Maintain strict separation throughout processing pipeline
  - Prevent privilege escalation from untrusted to trusted context

- **Content Filtering & Sanitization**
  - Implement granular filtering for all webpage content
  - Strip executable code from untrusted sources
  - Validate and sanitize all external data before processing
  - Apply CSP (Content Security Policy) enforcement

- **Instruction Validation**
  - Verify all instructions originate from trusted user context
  - Reject or quarantine commands from webpage content
  - Log all trust boundary crossing attempts
  - Implement signature verification for user commands

### 2. Mandatory Veto Controls
**Objective**: Enforce human-in-the-loop controls for privacy and security-sensitive actions

#### Privacy/Security Action Categories:
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Credential submission
- Financial transactions
- Permission grants
- System configuration changes
- File system access
- Network connections to new domains

#### Docker MCP Interceptor Integration:
- **Intercept Layer**
  - Hook into Docker MCP (Model Context Protocol) communication
  - Identify security-sensitive operations before execution
  - Queue actions requiring user approval
  - Implement timeout policies for pending approvals

- **Veto Control Mechanism**
  - Present clear action summaries to user
  - Require explicit approval/denial for sensitive operations
  - Log all veto decisions with timestamps
  - Support batch approval with individual review
  - Emergency kill switch for suspicious activity

- **Policy Engine**
  - Define customizable security policies
  - Support allowlist/blocklist patterns
  - Remember user preferences per domain
  - Escalate unusual patterns for manual review

### 3. Runtime/Container/K8s Hardening
**Objective**: Secure the underlying infrastructure and runtime environment

#### mTLS (Mutual TLS) Implementation:
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**
  - Generate and manage certificate authorities
  - Issue certificates for all services
  - Enforce mutual authentication for inter-service communication
  - Implement automatic certificate rotation
  - Use short-lived certificates (24-hour expiry)

- **Configuration**
  - Deploy Cert-Manager or similar PKI solution
  - Configure service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for mTLS
  - Set strict TLS version requirements (TLS 1.3+)
  - Disable insecure fallback protocols

#### Pod Security Admission:
- **Security Standards Enforcement**
  - Apply Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS)
  - Enforce "restricted" profile for all pods
  - Prevent privileged container execution
  - Block host namespace sharing
  - Restrict volume types and host path access

- **Policy Configuration**
  - Create PodSecurityPolicy or PSA admission rules
  - Enforce read-only root filesystems
  - Require non-root user execution
  - Set resource limits and quotas
  - Drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities

#### Network Policies:
- **Zero Trust Networking**
  - Default deny all traffic
  - Explicitly allow only required connections
  - Segment services by namespace
  - Implement egress filtering

- **Policy Rules**
  - Browser pods can only access approved external domains
  - Database pods accept connections only from app layer
  - No pod-to-pod communication across security zones
  - Log all blocked connection attempts
  - Rate limiting and DDoS protection

- **Monitoring & Enforcement**
  - Deploy Calico or Cilium for advanced network policies
  - Implement network flow logging
  - Alert on policy violations
  - Periodic policy audit and review

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Trust Segregation
1. Implement context tagging system in core engine
2. Add content filtering and sanitization layer
3. Deploy instruction validation framework
4. Add comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 2: Veto Controls
1. Design Docker MCP interceptor architecture
2. Implement action classification system
3. Build user approval interface
4. Create policy configuration system
5. Test with various security scenarios

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Hardening
1. Deploy mTLS infrastructure:
   - Setup certificate authority
   - Configure service mesh
   - Issue and distribute certificates
   - Test mutual authentication

2. Implement Pod Security Admission:
   - Define security policies
   - Apply PSA labels to namespaces
   - Audit existing workloads
   - Remediate non-compliant pods

3. Configure Network Policies:
   - Document required traffic flows
   - Create NetworkPolicy manifests
   - Deploy policies incrementally
   - Monitor and tune rules

## Security Considerations

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers prevent single point of failure
- **Fail Secure**: System defaults to deny on error/uncertainty
- **Auditability**: All security decisions logged immutably
- **Minimal Privilege**: Each component runs with minimum required permissions
- **Regular Review**: Security policies reviewed and updated quarterly

## Testing & Validation

- Penetration testing of trust boundary enforcement
- Fuzzing of content filtering mechanisms
- Verify all sensitive actions trigger veto controls
- Validate mTLS prevents unauthorized access
- Confirm network policies block unauthorized traffic
- Load testing with security controls active

## Monitoring & Metrics

- Trust boundary violation attempts
- Veto control approval/denial rates
- Certificate expiry and rotation status
- Pod security policy violations
- Network policy block events
- System performance impact metrics

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine this outline with security team
2. Prioritize implementation phases
3. Allocate development resources
4. Begin Phase 1: Trust Segregation implementation
5. Setup continuous security scanning in CI/CD
